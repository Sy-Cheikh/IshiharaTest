# Ishihara Test Simulation





## Name
IshiharaTest


## Description

This test, invented in 1917 by Shinobu Ishihara, is a collection of 38 plates used to screen for colour vision abnormalities.

These tests, consisting of "pseudo-isochromatic" plates, are most frequently used for the detection of congenital deficiencies of the red and green hues. Some also test for abnormalities in blue perception. 

The purpose of the test is to identify individuals who cannot distinguish a pattern in an image of approximately uniform luminance that appears only in the chrominances. PCA(Principal component analysis) was used to distinguish the pattern.
